# Restaurant Reservation Project

This is a project made for a restaurant to use for taking and keeping track of reservations, along with their tables and past reservations. The layout is meant to be user friendly and intuitive. This is for restaurant use and not ready for customers, because they would have access to manipulate the reservations and tables.

This project is something I build from the ground up. Full stack! I think I enjoyed working with the server side more than I anticipated, which was a pleasant surprise. I remember handling the tests that were premade into this project were quite tedious, due to timeout issues, but it all worked out in the end. I am looking forward to my next full stack project!

## Goals

- Your backend must be a Node, Express, and PostgreSQL API.
- You must at least create, read, and update multiple resources within the application. The user stories in the final capstone will cover these requirements.
- Use React along with the API that you built as part of the final capstone.
- Your app must be responsive and work just as well on mobile devices as it does on desktop devices.
- You may use vanilla CSS or Bootstrap for styling the frontend.
- The styling on your client must be polished. In other words, you need to choose fonts and colors that make sense, correctly size the various components, and make sure that it looks great on both mobile and desktop devices.
- You must deploy a live, publicly accessible version of your application.
